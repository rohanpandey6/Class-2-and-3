What is HTTP:
HTTP is a application layer protocol sent over a TCP connection that helps in exchanging information between a client and a remote server over the internet.

HTTP 1.1
#########

Before HTTP 1.1, separate TCP connections were made for each request which increased the load on the servers and caused a lot of congestion as client had to make multiple requests to the same server for fetching different elements of the website in a short amount of time.

HTTP/1.1 takes care of this problem by introducing persistent connections and pipe-lining.

Persistent connections and pipe-lining: 
- With persistent connections, HTTP/1.1 assumes that a TCP connection should be kept open unless directly told to close. This allows the client to send multiple requests along the same connection without waiting for a response to each (pipe-lining), greatly improving the performance of HTTP/1.1 over HTTP/1.0.

- By opening and closing fewer TCP connections, CPU time and memory used for TCP protocol control blocks can be saved.

HTTP 2

Came in as a successor to HTTP 1.1 to tackle some of the problems with HTTP 1.1 especially in the areas of optimization.
Needless to say, it is faster than HTTP 1.1 as it provides additional features as discussed below.

Features:

- Multiplexing: Enables Multiple requests (in parallel) over single TCP connection, which enables prioritization of requested files which can speed up page load thereby reducing round trip time.

- Uses HPACK to compress redundant header frames as Both client and server maintain a list of headers used in previous client-server requests.

- Binary Protocol: As opposed to HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format, HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format, which makes the network footprint lighter and is less prone to errors.

- Has Server push capability which sends additional data that is anticipated in future requests in the response to the client.
